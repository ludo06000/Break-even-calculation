# Break-even-calculation
 
 Vanilla JavaScript break-even application.
 
 Calculation of a profit or loss based on a margin rate and an amount of annual fixed costs.
 
 Calculation of an annual break-even point. The break-even point is the amount of turnover corresponding to a zero result.

Chart :

I used the Chart.js library to display the fixed costs and the contribution margin curves.
The intersection between the two curves corresponds to the turnover to be achieved to have a profit at ZERO.

Calculation: break-even point = fixed costs / margin on variable costs

 
 
NB: It should be noted that these calculations are simplified to give a rough idea of the result.
